//! <fullname>Backup gateway</fullname>
//! <p>Backup gateway connects Backup to your hypervisor, so you can
//! create, store, and restore backups of your virtual machines (VMs) anywhere, whether
//! on-premises or in the VMware Cloud (VMC) on Amazon Web Services.</p>
//! <p>Add on-premises resources by connecting to a hypervisor through a gateway. Backup will automatically discover the resources in your hypervisor.</p>
//! <p>Use Backup to assign virtual or on-premises resources to a backup plan, or run
//! on-demand backups. Once you have backed up your resources, you can view them and restore them
//! like any resource supported by Backup.</p>
//! <p>To download the Amazon Web Services software to get started, navigate to the Backup console, choose <b>Gateways</b>, then choose <b>Create gateway</b>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
